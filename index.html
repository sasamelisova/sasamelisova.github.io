        <p class="my_description">Dedicated software development student at Unicorn University in Prague, embarking on a
          transformative career journey from a background as a physiotherapist. My interest in
          programming sparked in the summer of 2022, leading me to pursue independent learning.
          Eager to formalize my skills, I joined Unicorn University in summer 2023 and I've
          independently undertaken a series of programming courses and completed several small
          projects.</p>
